          <p>I am a 31 year old registered nurse and although I was born in Baltimore, MD I consider myself a native Washingtonian. I've lived in the PNW since I was a year old which means I've been here so long that I actually miss the rain when we get crazy -48 hour- stretches of sunshine in the summer. I enjoy all the cliche activities there are to do in the PNW including hiking, camping, kayaking, and complaining about the weather. While I've considered moving to other cities in the U.S (briefly when the wind is blowing the rain in such a way that defies grafity and goes directly under my umbrella and into my face), Seattle will always be home.</p>
          <p>My biggest accomplishment would definitely be my 9 years working in the medical field as a nurse. Nursing was definitely not my first choice for a career but I knew it would be a steady job where my skills would always be needed, and it would also be a job where I would continually be learning. Working as a nurse is an incredibly hard job, not only physically and mentally but many times emotionally as well. In a perfect world, every medical treatment would work and all members of the medical team would be paid fairly for the work they do, but unfortunately in the real world people get paid more to throw a ball around than to save people's lives. I'm excited about this new chapter in my life, to once again learn something completely new and build a career out of it. Even so, nursing played a huge role in shaping the person that I am today and I will always hold it near and dear to my heart. </p>
