          <h5 class="mt-0">About Me</h5>
          <p>I am a 31 year old registered nurse and although I was born in Baltimore, MD I consider myself a native Washingtonian. I've lived in the PNW since I was a year old which means I've been here so long that I actually miss the rain when we get crazy -48 hour- stretches of sunshine in the summer. I enjoy all the cliche activities there are to do in the PNW including hiking, camping, kayaking, and complaining about the weather. While I've considered moving to other cities in the U.S (briefly when the wind is blowing the rain in such a way that defies grafity and goes directly under my umbrella and into my face), Seattle is truly the only city for me.</p>
          <p>You can't be a Seattlelite without being an animal lover, which is no problem for me because I love all the animals. I've always had cats and although they sometimes get a bad rep (some cats are crazy) I've always had the sweetest, most laid back cats. Lysandro (named after the hunk in a spanish soap opera) was my first love, I got him when I was 13 years old and he lived a long 17 years before going to kitty heaven. I now own Tiberius (you also have to be a Star Trek fan to live in Seattle) or Ty for short, who is 5 years old and both the sweetest and the dumbest cat you'll ever meet. Don't leave any food out though because it'll be gone when you go back to get it, plastic wrap and all. My youngest baby is Cuzco (also a fan of The Emperor's New Groove -yes that's a cartoon- yes I'm 31) and he is my pride and joy. I'm happy to report that he is as obsessed with me as I am with him. I could go on about him forever but I've probably already worried you with all my talk about cats. Don't worry, I love dogs too. </p>
