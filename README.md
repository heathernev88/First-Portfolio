Responsive webpage using BootStrap
3 webpages: an About Me page, a portfolio page showing personal achievements, and a contact page
About me is short description of me personally, with picture and an inspirational quote
Portfolio is still very limited but plan on adding more as class continues and programming skills increase
Contact page not active, just for looks
Page has been made to fit smaller devices as well as large screens
Every page has active links, and headers match
